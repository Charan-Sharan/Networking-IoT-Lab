# [WIP] Setting Up Internet for the Lab with Static IP

The second task involved setting up the **internet connection** for the lab using a **static IP** provided by the ISP. This ensures that the lab's network devices have a consistent and reliable IP address, which is essential for setting up servers, IoT devices, and network services.

## Steps Taken:
- Coordinated with the ISP to obtain a static IP address for the lab's primary router.
- Configured the router's WAN interface to use the static IP, ensuring a stable internet connection for the lab network.
- Tested connectivity to external networks to ensure the static IP was functioning as expected and the internet connection was stable.
