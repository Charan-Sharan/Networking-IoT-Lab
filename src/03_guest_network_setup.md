# [WIP] Guest Network Setup

The third task involved setting up a **guest network** to isolate guest devices from the main network. This ensures security and prevents unauthorized access to lab devices and services.

## Steps Taken:
- Configured the router to create a new SSID dedicated to guests.
- Set up the guest network with restricted access to the main network and limited bandwidth, ensuring secure browsing.
- Implemented necessary firewall rules to prevent guests from accessing internal devices or services.
- Tested the guest network setup to ensure proper isolation and internet access.
